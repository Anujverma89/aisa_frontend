measurement units : PX, EM, REM, %, VW, VH  
font-size : Px, EM, REMposition: absolute;  
        top: 0xp;  
        left: 0px;  
sizing & margin : VW, VH, %  
If you want to create a responsive design it's better idea to use REM, EM , VH, VW, or %  
```


### Css positions 
```
Static : Position is a default position for every element.
Relative : It's position in calculated from the current position of the div.
Fixed : Postion is applied and calculated from the top of the window 
Absolute : Position is calculated from the start and top of the window.
Sticky : It is also calculated from the top 

border radius : if we apply on % it creates ellipse, If we apply in px it creates a rounded rectangle.
